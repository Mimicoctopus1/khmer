        <p>The Khmer language is much alike and yet unlike the English language. For example, both use phonetic alphabet, meaning that each letter of the alphabet corresponds to a sound that, when strung together, makes a word with meaning. However, Khmer prioritizes nouns over adjectives, unlike the English language, which puts adjectives before nouns in a sentence. Also, while both languages combine consonants and vowels horizontally, Khmer has a way of putting vowels over, under, and even around other letters.
While Khmer and English are both languages, they work in very different ways as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            English and Khmer both use a phonetic alphabet, which means that each letter has a sound to be used in a word. However, a vowel sound in Khmer can be changed depending on what letter is in front of it. For example, the ·û∂ in ·ûÄ·û∂ would be pronounced ƒÉ (as in apple), while the ·û∂ in ·ûÉ·û∂ would be pronounced ƒì≈≠ (as in Leah). Also, English rules say that words must always have a vowel in them, and there cannot be a one-letter word unless it is a vowel (‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù). However, Khmer is the opposite; a consonant can be a word, and a vowel can‚Äôt. An example would be ·ûÄ (meaning neck). Again, English and Khmer use the same type of alphabet, but they both have characteristics that make them different.
        </p>
        <p>
        Another way English and Khmer are different is the way that adjectives and nouns are used. In English, one might say, ‚ÄúThe limits of your language are the limits of your world‚Äù (Ludwig Wittgenstein), but in Khmer you would say, ‚ÄúThe limits of language your are the limits of world your.‚Äô Actually, directly translated, you would technically say, ‚ÄúLimits language your is limits world your.‚Äù Again, even though these languages are similar, their words are positioned differently.
        </p>
        <p>
        Words aren‚Äôt the only thing positioned differently in Khmer. Vowels are often placed on top of or around previous letters. Also, consonants have other versions known as ‚Äúfeet‚Äù or ‚Äúsubscripts‚Äù that make the same sound but look different ‚ÄúMost subscript consonants resemble the corresponding consonant symbol, but in a smaller and possibly simplified form, although in a few cases there is no obvious resemblance. Most subscript consonants are written directly below other consonants, although subscript r appears to the left, while a few others have ascending elements which appear to the right.‚Äù <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_script">(Wikipedia, Khmer script)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Khmer and English are very similar in speech while also very different in writing. Both use letters that represent sounds, but Khmer and English position letters and words in different places. They are both used in the same way but are still different on the outside.
